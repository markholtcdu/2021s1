    It takes a fraction of a second to send an email across the world.
â€œLatencyâ€ is the time it takes a message to be read by a human.
Before 1970 most computers were not networked.
Networks began so that people could share data and resources.
In the 1950s and 1960s computers were networked between buildings.
Sneakernet means someone walks data from one computer to another.
A Local Area Network (LAN) is always in the same room.
A LAN can be made up of thousands of computers.
ETHERNET is a technology for LAN
The address says what computer a message should be sent to.
Addresses are in the headers of data packets.
In an Ethernet every computer processes every packet of data sent.
Every computer has its own unique MAC code for internet or ethernet.
The carrier for wifi is the air. 
CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access) means only one computer can sense a carrier.
Bandwidth is the speed a carrier can send and receive data.
 Exponential backoff means a computer will wait a decreasing amount of time before attempting to send a signal on a network.
 It is not possible to own a dedicated network line.
 A network switch means data is always sent to all parts of a network.
 A route is the system of switches a message travels along on the internet.
 The number of switches a message goes through is called the hop count.
 Packet switching means a large message is cut into smaller packets and sent along the same route.
 Every computer connected to the internet has an IP address.
An IP address is four eight digit numbers e.g. 172.217.7.238
The latest packet switching network is called the ARPANET.
ARPANET started with less than 50 computers.
There are more computers online than human beings in the world.
