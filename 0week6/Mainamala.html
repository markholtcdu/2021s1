    <p class="correct"> It takes a fraction of a second to send an email across the world.</p>
    <p class="correct"> Latency is the time it takes a message to be read by a human.</p>
    <p class="wrong"> Before 1970 most computers were not networked.</p>
    <p class="correct"> Networks began so that people could share data and resources.</p>
    <p class="correct"> In the 1950s and 1960s computers were networked between buildings.</p>
    <p class="wrong"> Sneakernet means someone walks data from one computer to another.</p>
    <p class="correct"> A Local Area Network (LAN) is always in the same room.</p>
    <p class="wrong"> A LAN can be made up of thousands of computers.</p>
    <p class="correct"> ETHERNET is a technology for LAN.</p>
    <p class="correct"> The address says what computer a message should be sent to.</p>
    <p class="correct"> Addresses are in the headers of data packets.</p>
    <p class="correct"> In an Ethernet every computer processes every packet of data sent.</p>
    <p class="wrong"> Every computer has its own unique MAC code for internet or ethernet.</p>
    <p class="correct"> The carrier for wifi is the air.</p>
    <p class="correct"> CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access) means only one computer can sense a carrier.</p>
    <p class="wrong"> Bandwidth is the speed a carrier can send and receive data.</p>
    <p class="correct"> Exponential backoff means a computer will wait a decreasing amount of time before attempting to send a signal on a network.</p>
    <p class="wrong"> It is not possible to own a dedicated network line.</p>
    <p class="correct"> A network switch means data is always sent to all parts of a network.</p>
    <p class="wrong"> A route is the system of switches a message travels along on the internet.</p>
    <p class="correct"> The number of switches a message goes through is called the hop count.</p>
    <p class="correct"> Packet switching means a large message is cut into smaller packets and sent along the same route.</p>
    <p class="wrong"> Every computer connected to the internet has an IP address.</p>
    <p class="correct"> An IP address is four eight digit numbers e.g. 172.217.7.238.</p>
    <p class="correct"> The latest packet switching network is called the ARPANET.</p>
    <p class="correct"> ARPANET started with less than 50 computers.</p>
    <p class="correct"> There are more computers online than human beings in the world.</p>
