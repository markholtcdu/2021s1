<h2>Decisions by Statistical algorithms</h2>
<br>
<li>FACT 1-Decision Tree A simple method of dividing the decision space into multiple boxes can be expressed as a so-called decision tree </li>
<li>A Decision Tree is a tree hierarchical structure with two types of nodes. First, internal nodes/decision nodes which splits the data (represented as circles) and second, leaf nodes/prediction nodes which makes a prediction (represented as hexagons). A Decision Tree can be deeper and wider depending upon the characteristics of data and/or amount of data. Decision nodes are used to examine the value of a given attribute.</li>
<li>FACT 2-Support vector machines use arbitrary rows to cut the decision space into blogs</li>

<h2>Artificial neural networks </h2>
<br>
<li>FACT 1-Artificial neurons accept digital inputs like human neurons, combine them, and then output digital</li>
<li>FACT 2-Recently, based on powerful processors and networks, deep neural networks have become practical. Years ago. Google and Lianlu show a deep neural network that can find faces and humans in photos. </li>

<h2>The future-Strong AI </h2>
<br>
<li>FACT 1-The explosive growth of digital knowledge as the perfect kindling for strong AI. In 2011, IBMDE WATSON consulted and integrated information in 200 million pages of content, including all wikipedia, and defeated its human competitor in Jeopardy </li>
<li>FACT 2-Reinforcement learning: AI can not only swallow a lot of information, but also learn much faster than humans. AlphaGo launched by Google in 2016 discovered successful strategies by copying millions of times to understand what works. </li>
