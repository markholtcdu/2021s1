          Dead Language come to life in a form of technology, in machine learning , commercial system for automated language translation is being useful and par with the human linguists,
          and far more easily. Decipherment of language is divided into two parts: one is, it uses a conventional neural network to foresee the correct character in each, and other one is, 
          it uses a linear program to minimize deviations of acquired vocabulary. Cao (2019) explains that translation of language automation without the training on parallel datasets
          genereally requires to know how two languages are being related, with similar alphabets, structure, and patterns; which are prredictable to be matched with other languages. 
          Lack of parallel data for training and for ancient texts, make decipherment very challenging for both user and machine. Sentences does not reorder it's characters, it just
          focus on the positions and changes the character with new alphabet which may be by deleting or putting a new one in a mess (Kirkpatrick 2011). Advancement of machine and artificial
          intelligence techniques is helping the scholars and people to preserve the language from extinction through technology.
