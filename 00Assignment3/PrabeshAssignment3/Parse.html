     <p>Parse Tree is important in Natural Language Processing as it helps to attach every words and reveals how the sentences are made. 
       Voice assistant is also refers in Parse where it is a semantic parsing component designed to understand the action given by the user which is the 
       expression of voice and voice assistant identify the voice by the requested of user. Liu (2016) describes as traditional semantic parsing can cut to a text form classification
       and sequence tagging problem, which is a standard architecture of parsing for many requested literature. Increasing number of users in virtual assisatnts shows the system
       is more complex to handle the queries of sequences. But the decoder 'BERT' uses with a Pointer Generator Network which gives the user a time to learn to generate pointers to 
       the source of sequence in a purposed (Jia 2016). Unified architecture in parsing for the task of semantic parsing for different sorts of quires is more useful.
