          Phrase Labelling tasks involves the identification of any phrases which is entered by any user in a sentence and refers to a single unit belonging to the marked section and
           later tagging these phrases with relevant category label. Noun Phrase (NP) is important and difficult problem in a same time in Natural Language Processing which is in a
           text refer to the same real-world presence. Anaphoricity limitation specifies that a non-anaphoric Noun Phrase (NP) cannot be coreference in any NP phrases so it can be 
           skip over these non-anaphoric NP. Although many existing machines are performing without any restriction through learning the approaches to coreference resolution, it can 
           perform without Anaphoricity determination according to Soon, et al. (2001). LP (Label Propagation) algorithm represents labeled and unlabeled examples within a connected
           graph. Bergsma (2008) describes a different method in detecting non-anaphoric pronouns with the context of pronouns through taking out from phrases, and collecting them
           in words within a large compilation and elucidate these distributions either Anaphoric or Non-anaphoric pronoun example. The difficulty of anaphoricity determination in 
           filtering out non-anaphoric pronouns and identifying anaphoric definite NPs.
