      <h2> Authentication </h2>
      <p class="box"> Password authentication is a series of numbers and letters chosen by a user to protect his/her privacy. These passwords codes are demanded at each login, only the user with the code should be able to access it. According to Richard Beno and Ron Poet, 2007, these password codes can be easily accessed by another computer if the code is not long enough.  </p>
      <p class="box"> Biometrics authentication security is a scanning security of our fingerprints or face. But this technology is probabilistic, it can mistake you with someone's else fingerprints or face in agreement with Rosa, et al. (2007).  </p>

      <h2> Access privileges </h2>
      <p class="box"> Access control is a control center that can give another user the permission to read, write and execute by commanding the operating system to do so. These access controls can be attacked as well by other users, said Stephen Smalley in 2001, and it can be dangerous for some users depending on their privacy.  </p>
      <p class="box"> Access of many users' files are provided to the public online. There are also top-secret files (ex: government files) which are secured and not accessible to the public. These types of files can be in danger if a hacker tries to access it. Top-secret files are usually well protected using other security controls.  </p>

      <h2> Malware </h2>
      <p class="box"> Hackers often use malware programs to infiltrate into another computer and give access to itself. By doing that the hacker has access to the computer which means all the user’s privacy, many important files are cyber-attacked according to Yassine Mekdad, et al (2021).  </p>
      <p class="box"> Security kernel is a minimal set of operating systems software that helps secure the information of a computer  and implements the basic security procedures for controlling access to system resources by enforcing the access control as reported by Sabah S. Al-Fedaghi in 2007.  </p>
