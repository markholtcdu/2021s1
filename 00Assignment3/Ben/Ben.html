      <h2> Authentication </h2>
      <p class="box"> Password authentication is a series of numbers and letters chosen by a user to protect his/her privacy. These passwords codes are demanded at each login, only the user with the code should be able to access it. According to Richard Beno and Ron Poet, 2007, these password codes can be easily accessed by another computer if the code is not long enough.  </p>
      <p class="box"> Biometrics authentication security is a scanning security of our fingerprints or face. But this technology is probabilistic, it can mistake you with someone's else fingerprints or face in agreement with Rosa, et al. (2007).  </p>

      <p class="box"> Access control is a control center that can give another user the permission to read, write and execute by commanding the operating system to do so. These access controls can be attacked as well by other users, said Stephen Smalley in 2001, and it can be dangerous for some users depending on their privacy.  </p>
