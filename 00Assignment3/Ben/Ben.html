      <h2> Passwords </h2>
      <ul>
        <li> The passwords should be a minimum of eight characters. Ideally, if the system allows, the password should be from 24 to 26 characters long. When creating a password, remember to include at least one of each of the following: uppercase letter, lowercase letter, special character and number. </li>

      <h2> Biometrics </h2>
       <ul>
         <li> Biological biometrics use traits at a genetic and molecular level. These may include features like DNA or your blood, which might be assessed through a sample of your bodyâ€™s fluids. </li>
         <li> Morphological biometrics involve the structure of your body. More physical traits like your eye, fingerprint, or the shape of your face can be mapped for use with security scanners. </li>
         <li> Behavioral biometrics are based on patterns unique to each person. How you walk, speak, or even type on a keyboard can be an indication of your identity if these patterns are tracked. </li>
