      <h2> Passwords </h2>
      <ul>
        <li> The passwords should be a minimum of eight characters. Ideally, if the system allows, the password should be from 24 to 26 characters long. When creating a password, remember to include at least one of each of the following: uppercase letter, lowercase letter, special character and number. </li>

      <h2> Biometrics </h2>
       <ul>
         <li> Biological biometrics use traits at a genetic and molecular level. These may include features like DNA or your blood, which might be assessed through a sample of your body’s fluids. </li>
         <li> Morphological biometrics involve the structure of your body. More physical traits like your eye, fingerprint, or the shape of your face can be mapped for use with security scanners. </li>
         <li> Behavioral biometrics are based on patterns unique to each person. How you walk, speak, or even type on a keyboard can be an indication of your identity if these patterns are tracked. </li>
      </ul>

      <h2> Access privileges </h2>
       <ul>
         <li> It's the access and permission for users, accounts, processes, and systems across an IT environment. By dialing in the appropriate level of privileged access controls, PAM helps organizations condense their organization’s attack surface, and prevent, or at least mitigate, the damage arising from external attacks as well as from insider malfeasance or negligence. </li>
