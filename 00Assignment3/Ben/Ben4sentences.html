    <p> Authentication of users is important for computer security. Authentication is normally done by passwords demanded at login with a series of numbers and letters chosen by a user to protect his/her privacy. According to Richard Beno and Ron Poet (2007), these password codes can be easily accessed by another computer if the code is not long enough. An alternative authentication is Biometrics. This involves scanning security of the fingerprints or face. But this technology is probabilistic, it can mistake people with someone's else fingerprints or face according to Rosa, et al. (2007). Secure passwords or biometric authentication is becoming increasingly necessary for maximum security of personal information.  </p>
    <p> Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. (link of citation:  https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-cyber-security). </p>
