      <h1>Lidar</h1>
   <li>LiDAR is the blending between the real-world and the virtual world which renders in three dimensions that contains interactive audio, video, image, text, and computer graphics. It can also be defined as adding virtual objects into the real world using electronic gadgets like robot, smartphones, iPad, tablets, or AR eyewear equipment. For instance, children are playing football on the ground. A robot landing on the same ground can be seen using lidar without bothering the children. (Qin et al., 2018). Children are the real objects whereas lidar is the virtual ones.
These pulses made are recorded which give precise three-dimensional information about the surface. AR cloud is used for sharing and collaborating lidar experiences with many users. It is a new way to organize world information. Similarly, anything that exists on this planet can be visualized accordingly to the person who has uploaded an AR cloud image. For example, a bridge that has not been built yet can be seen as completely constructed with a smartphone because the 3D image of that bridge is uploaded by the bridge designer in the AR cloud. Kim et al., (2018) explored, Cloud-based real-time lidar consists of an AR mapper, tracker, and display which creates a third-dimensional space where the result is displayed betwixt the real environment and the camera.
