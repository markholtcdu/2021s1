      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
     <li> The robot has been one of the great innovation of of human kind. This report has presented how robotics material and robot has become a reliable technology for engineers. The AR-based Lidar system is a dependable system for many topographies. It applies AR schedule simulation which prevents from being overlapped with 3D objects. In the same way, end effector and locomotive device is mostly being used by architecture engineers to assume how a structure looks in a certain location. Moreover, these three parts of robot mechanism is optimized by software that uses even more Robot technology. Studying method that gives importance to the robotics is now not a problem since AR technology is introduced in the field of engineering education. Besides having countless advantages, this technology should be in good hands. These types of technology should be handled carefully and should make reach out of hackers which can also show the challenges Robot is facing in this modern era. After analyzing and scrutinizing information, this report concludes that further research and future works should focus more on Lidar, end effector and locomotive device and make this technology cheap and convenient for sustainability and the increasing ability of robot.   </li>
