            <h2>Self-driving car</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>With autonomous driving, people only need to accelerate or decelerate and control the direction of the car.</li>
                <li>At the same time, sensors and vision algorithms are needed to better improve autonomous driving</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="bottom">
                <li>Nowadays, self-driving cars have become a fast-developing field with bright prospects. Due to the rapid development of autonomous vehicle technology, new challenges and requirements that continue to increase in the road milestones are also growing. The author Alberto Broggi et al. (2015) mentioned that the two sensors of the autopilot aura are static obstacles and dynamic obstacles in the obstacle representative. Obstacles represent the first of a critical aspect: static obstacles that can also be mapped are pretty straightforward to manage, but robust perception algorithms are mandatory in dynamic obstacles. If obstacles behaviour can not be predicted, perception must be very sharp, and the path planner must also consider this issue.</li>
<li>Another author, Alberto Broggi et al. (2015), also mentioned the new challenges of autonomous vehicles, positioning systems, such as lane-keeping, intersections joining, obstacles avoidance, and control speed according to the flowing traffic. The demonstration took place in urban traffic, and the maximum speed was about 60 km/h. To improve both accuracy and integrity of the positioning information, a landmark-based positioning system was used.</li>

            <h2>Android robot</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Trying to turn android robot into a virtual robot world.</li>
                <li>Android robots have the same appearance and behavior as humans.</li>

            </ul>
            <div class="bottom">
                <li>The Android robot is an anthropomorphic robot designed to look and behave like a human. According to the author’s description, he mentioned a female robot whose appearance, height, and weight are similar to the appearance of a natural person. The robot mainly Uses this system to help people with ASD and anxiety participate in conversation tasks effectively (for example, job interviews, conversations, social skills interventions).</li>
                <li>The ambitions of modern robotics are not limited to imitating humans but also to make robots that walk and talk indistinguishable from humans. Therefore the author Rosario Sorbello et al. (2014) also mentioned the action behaviours of humans and humanoid robots. A GUI button or a GUI tablet controls the specific movements of the arms and head to embody the operator's behaviours and emotions remotely. The aim is to create a minimal human embodiment that allows any individual to transfer her/his presence or, better, visualize it in a distant location by mediation.</li>

            <h2>Arm robot</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Help people make things or transport large items</li>
                <li>Robots can reduce their own error rate through continuous machine learning and practice</li>

            </ul>
            <div class="bottom">
                <li>Artificial arm robots are an area that people have been exploring and researching in the future of science and technology. Based on the head gestures detected by Google Glass's multi-sensor fusion, the NAO humanoid robot can be controlled hands-free. However, with the development of technology, the operation task becomes more and more complicated. The author pointed out that using Google Glass to guide the NAO robot to transport large objects in an environment with obstacles. Indeed, such a controllable robotic arm allows operators to make immediate decisions.</li>
<li>Not only that, but the author also mentioned another kind of robotic arm. Potential applications of this SEA include exoskeleton robots, assistive robots, and flexible manipulators, which has an adaptive command filter backstepping control (CFBC) design that reduces the integrator backstepping control Complexity issues in.</li>
