                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                </div>

                <p class="box"> In the rapidly developing 21st century, robots are changing the world and the way people live. Robot (Robot) is a kind of intelligent machines which can do semi-autonomous or fully autonomous work.This paper is about autonomous driving
                    technology, how Android robots and robotic arms work and how they solve problems. It will not be long these devices are on the market to help people do their jobs.

                    <h2>Self-driving cars</h2>
                </div>

                <p class="box">Self-driving cars will inevitably be a trend in the future, which can help people reduce traffic accidents. Self-driving cars need the support of algorithms and sensor information to be sensitive to road obstacles. The author Alberto Broggi
                    et al. (2015) mentioned that the two sensors of the autopilot aura are static obstacles and dynamic obstacles in the obstacle representative. Obstacles represent the first of a critical aspect: static obstacles that can also be mapped
                    are pretty straightforward to manage, but robust perception algorithms are mandatory in dynamic obstacles. If obstacles behavior can not be predicted, perception must be very sharp, and the path planner must also consider this issue.

                    <h2>Android robot</h2>
                </div>

                <p class="box">Android robot is a kind of anthropomorphic robot. The robot is similar to humans in appearance and behaviour and can help autistic and anxious patients with rehabilitation activities. According to the description of the author Kumazaki
                    et al. (2018) and others, he mentioned a female robot whose appearance, height and weight are similar to the formation of real people. The robot mainly uses the system to help patients with ASD and anxiety participate in practical
                    dialogue tasks (for example, Job interviews, conversations, social skills interventions).</p>

                    <h2>mechanical arm</h2>
                </div>

                <p class="box">Artificial weapons are vital to helping humanity—an artificial arm based on Google Glass multi-function sensor to control the robot's arm. XiaoQian et al. (2017) used Google Glass to guide NAO robots to transport large objects in an obstacle
                    environment. This controlled robotic arm allows the operator to make immediate decisions. Not only that, but Yongping et al. (2017) also mentioned another robotic arm. Potential applications of the SEA include exoskeleton robots, assistive
                    robots, and flexible manipulators. The adaptive command filter backstepping control (CFBC) design reduces the integrator's Complexity issues reverse control.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                </div>

                <p class="box"> Autonomous driving technology, Android robots and robot arms are all essential milestones in the development of robots. It also needs to continuously improve and improve on the existing basis before it can be put into the market to help
                    humanity.
