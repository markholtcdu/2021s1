<h2>Driverless cars</h2>
                <li>The bomb disposal robots was a Wheelbarrow robot in the early 1970s. 
            It was used as an IRA to detonate a large number of bombs in the early 1970s, 
            mainly for car bombs, which also left behind the wealthy and powerful Britain at that time. (Debbie & Lisle 2019) 
            Today's bomb disposal robots have the characteristics of helping people to operate EOD robots more efficiently and simply in military,
            education, engineering, etc., such as carrying out reconnaissance, transfer, dismantling and destruction.
            As EOD robots will be widely expected and used in the future, people are actively developing this technology. 
            In the QIN (2010) article, the collision detection technology of EOD robots is mentioned.
            In order to simulate the real world, this technology must restrict the movement of the observer and the movement of the moving object, 
            so as to avoid the occurrence of the moving body encountering 
            The phenomenon of "passing through walls" when building or obstacles. This is indeed a big obstacle in the field of robotics.</li>
<li>The author Qin (2010) also pointed out the principle of VEGA collision detection. When
            the intersecting vector is added to a dynamic object or observer, 
            a sense of reality is also added to the application. 
            This principle provides a real-time detection method for the VEGA engine</li>

<h2>Drones</h2>
                <li>Drones, this is a project that is more and more common and developed in military,
            engineering or life, but it also brings a lot of troubles about drones.
            The author (Wendie L & Kellington 2017) mentioned FAA and NASA 
            An unreasonable driving traffic management system (UTM)
            that damages the property of the drone owner was established in a tight time.</li>   
<li>his makes small drones flying below 500 feet also need air traffic control, and even large drones. 
            So it was shot down in flight. This fact does show that there are still questions about 
            whether drones have freedom in the air domain. 
            The second problem is that according to Henry H et al (2015),
            they mentioned that restricting the operation of drones has hidden risks of height, 
            weight, and impacting at any time.</li>

<h2>Driverless cars</h2>

                <li>Self-driving cars already exist and are gradually being used in people's lives in today's world. 
              The World Health Organization points out that 1.2 million people die in traffic accidents each year (WHO, 2015).
              Driverless cars are considered to an important technology to reduce partial deaths caused by human error (Kyriakidis et al., 2015). 
              In the author's (Kanwal & Giselle) article, they cited (Benenson et al., 2008; Godoy et al., 2015). 
              The viewpoint stated that most people believe that driverless cars will not become a global leader in the near of future. 
              Mainstream on most roads and according to Miralles & Domene (2010) mentioned the most likely adoption settings may be in closed environments 
              such as university campuses, airports, golf courses, holiday parks and retirement villages.</li>
                <li>Self-driving cars on the roads of the future It is an inevitable trend that the self-driving car will still need to be verified in future practice.
              According to the author Tao et al (2017) and others, it remains a major challenge
              when using automotive sensors such as single-frequency Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, 
              a lane detection camera, and proprioceptive sensors. 
              The technology is still immature and still requires a lot of time and investment to benefit people’s lives.</li>
