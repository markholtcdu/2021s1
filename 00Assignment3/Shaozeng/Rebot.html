  <p class="background">Robot is the common name of automatic control machine (Robot). Automatic control machine includes all machinery that simulates human behavior or 
  thought and simulates other creatures (such as robot dog, cat or even human!).</p>

  <p>The bomb disposal robot is a wheelbarrow robot in the early 1970s. It was used as an IRA to detonate a large number of bombs,
      mainly for car bombs (Debbie and Lyle 2019). Today, bomb disposal robots have more powerful functions. In military, education, 
      Reconnaissance, transfer, demolition and destruction can be carried out in the engineering field. 
      As bomb disposal robots will be widely expected and used in the future, people are actively developing this technology. </p>

  <p>Karmakar and other authors (2021)sustain that driverless vehicles will considerably reduce traffic congestions, accidents, carbon emissions,
    and enhance the accessibility of driving to wider cross-section of people and lifestyle choices. 
    However, people's main concerns are about its privacy and security. </p>

  <pThe development and use of drones in various fields has brought many benefits and inconveniences to the people.
        The author (Wendie L & Kellington 2017) mentioned that the FAA and NASA's unreasonable driving traffic management system (UTM) established behaviors 
  that damage the property of drone owners in a short period of time. </p>
