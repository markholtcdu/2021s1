  <p class="background">Robot is the common name of automatic control machine (Robot). Automatic control machine includes all machinery that simulates human behavior or 
  thought and simulates other creatures (such as robot dog, cat or even human!).</p>

  <p class="main point"> This essay will discuss in Android robots, unmanned robots and self-driving car robots.  </p>
  <p class="statement"> This shows the broad range of meaning for robots.</p>
  
  
  <p>Android robots,The authors Yoshikawa etal(2019) support which are a type of humanoid robot with appearances quite similar to that of humans,
    are expected to adapt to the role of training partners of face-to-face communication for individuals 
    with ASD and to create easier experiences transferrable to humans.</p>
  
  
  <p>He explained that Android robots can help some people with depression treat psychological problems like humans. </p>
  <p>Karmakar and other authors (2021)sustain that driverless vehicles will considerably reduce traffic congestions, accidents, carbon emissions,
    and enhance the accessibility of driving to wider cross-section of people and lifestyle choices. 
    However, at present, people's main concerns are about its privacy and security. </p>
  <p> He explained people's problems with the credit and use of self-driving cars and how to solve these problems. </p>
  
  <p>The bomb disposal robot was a wheelbarrow robot from the early 1970s. In the early 1970s, it was used as an IRA to detonate a large number of bombs, 
    mainly for car bombs. At that time, the wealthy and powerful Britain was left behind. 
    (Debbie & Lisle 2019) Today's bomb disposal robots have features that help people operate EOD robots more effectively and simply in military,
    education, engineering and other fields, such as conducting reconnaissance,
    transfer, dismantling and destruction. As EOD robots will be widely expected and used in the future, people are actively developing this technology. </p>
