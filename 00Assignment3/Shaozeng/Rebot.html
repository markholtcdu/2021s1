  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p class="background">Robot is the common name of automatic control machine (Robot). Automatic control machine includes all machinery that simulates human behavior or 
  thought and simulates other creatures (such as robot dog, cat or even human!).</p> 
  <p class="main topic">In the narrow sense, there are still many classifications 
  and disputes about the definition of robots. Some computer programs are even called robots.

  <p class="main point"> This essay will discuss in bomb disposal robot, self-driving car robots and drones robot.  </p>
  <p class="statement"> This shows the broad range of meaning for robots.</p>

  <p>The bomb disposal robot is a wheelbarrow robot in the early 1970s. It was used as an IRA to detonate a large number of bombs,
      mainly for car bombs (Debbie and Lyle 2019). Today, bomb disposal robots have more powerful functions. In military, education, 
      Reconnaissance, transfer, demolition and destruction can be carried out in the engineering field.</p> 
      <p>As bomb disposal robots will be widely expected and used in the future, people are actively developing this technology. </p>

  <p>Self-driving cars still need to be verified in future practice, which is an inevitable trend. According to the author Tao et al. (2017) and others,
      automotive sensors are still a major challenge for Self-driving cars, such as single-frequency global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers, 
      lane detection cameras and proprioceptive sensors.</p>
      <p>The technology is still immature and still requires a lot of time and investment to benefit people's lives.  </p>

  <p>The development and use of drones in various fields has brought many benefits and inconveniences to the people.</p>
        <p>The author (Wendie L & Kellington 2017) mentioned that the FAA and NASA's unreasonable driving traffic management system (UTM) established behaviors 
  that damage the property of drone owners in a short period of time. </p>

<p>In summary, EOD robots, self-driving cars, and drones are all important in the field of robotics, 
   and they still need people's efforts to explore and develop. </p>
