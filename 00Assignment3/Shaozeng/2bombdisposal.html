    <h1>Rebot</h1>
   <p>The bomb disposal robot is a wheelbarrow robot in the early 1970s. It was used as an IRA to detonate a large number of bombs,
      mainly for car bombs (Debbie and Lyle 2019). Today, bomb disposal robots have more powerful functions. In military, education, 
      Reconnaissance, transfer, demolition and destruction can be carried out in the engineering field.</p> 
      <p>As bomb disposal robots will be widely expected and used in the future, people are actively developing this technology. </p>
