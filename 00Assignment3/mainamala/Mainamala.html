        <li> Mobile devices, computers, and other technological wonders are now being used in the classroom. There is no doubt that they are beneficial, but in some cases, they have negative implications too. In this post, we will discuss the pros and cons of modern technology in education </li>
        <li> Independent learning has become easier and more efficient also learning technology is much more intresting </li>
