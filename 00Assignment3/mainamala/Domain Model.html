      <h1>Domain Model<h1>
        <p class = "box">  Domain models are created by hand, taking hundreds of hours of development time to model a single hour of instructional material. This type of limits applications to used one out of many possible models that capture the operational knowledge for a domain. To best serve a broad population of students, applications therefore need multiple models that optimize different educational objectives. A new approach for rapid , objective-driven creation of domain models that is based on program synthesis .We realize this approach in RULESY, a framework that assists developers with creating tactics and domain models that optimize desired objectives. In addition to annotation based interfaces to support collaborative learning, which have roots directly in the domain model, also other different forms of more explicit, direct-collaboration can be interconnected with in the educational cources based on the light weight domain model. According to (Srba and Bielikovaa 2014) proposed a collaborative extension popCorm for ALEF , aimed to support collaborative tasks such as group discussion. The RULESY framework was motivated by pratical experience the first and last authors work for Enlearn, , an educational technology company building adaptive K12 applications that need custom domain models</p>
