        < p class ="box"> An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer implementable instructions typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are always used as a specifications for performing data processing, calculations, automated reasoning and other task In computers systems, an algorithm is basically an instance of logic written in software by software developers, to be effective for the intended target computers(s) to produce output from given output. According to Chabert, Jean-Luc (2012) the concept of algorithm has existed since antiquity and Arithmetic algorithms such as a division algorithm was used by ancient Babylonian mathematicians c. 2500 BC and Egyptian mathematicians c. 1500 BC. The word algorithm itself is derived from the name of the 9th-centuary mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, whose nisba (identifying him as from Khwarazm) was latinized as Algorithm. Algorithm is important because it allows for the analysis on different ways to compute things and ultimately come up with the best way to solve particular problems </p>
